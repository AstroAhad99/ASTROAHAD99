### This Tutorial is about pushing the a locally built repo to Git :)

1. Create an empty repository on github
2. Open up the VS Code
3. Open the bash terminal
4. As this is a new locally created folder so we have to do some steps. Type the following commands:

    1. ```git init``` to initalize the repo  
    2. ``` ls -a ``` to see list of currently available files in my local folder
    3. ```git add .``` to add all the files in my repo
    4. ```git commit -m "Some Discription"``` To commit the changes in the repo with a description

5. Now to push this local repo to web, type the following command

    ``` git remote add origin https://github.com/AstroAhad99/ASTROAHAD99.git ```

6. Done :)
