1. Review the lesson of termination in 2.2 Introduction to Algorithms

2. When designing the algorithm you might use loops to control something.

3. It is important that look for some parameters that become smaller or larger to conclude the algorithm on something.

4. The algorithm must work on some cases and some not.

5. When the algorithm has a loop then a programmer needs to find a condition where it get out of the loop to move ahead.
