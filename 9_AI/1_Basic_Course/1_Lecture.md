1. We are going to learn narrow AI which means using the application of the AI in different fields.

2. AI is evolving so fast that everyday we have different tools are coming.

3. Goal:
    1. Skills development
    2. Hands on practice
    3. Problem solving and critical thinking expertise development.
    4. Effective self presentation
    5. Practical application

4. Artificial Intelligence is all about models.

5. Data to train model makes it smart.

6. API is an intermediate system that takes information from 1 place to another. Talks with model and give the result.

7. Trainig, Data, Model, API are the important terms. 

8. There are two different sections of data. One is trainig data and another data is testing data. DATA is very important.

9. Model is useless without data.

10. Chat GPT is trained on our data.

11. Defination of AI: 1 branch of computer science (other branches includes Blockchain, IoT, cyber security, and many other) deals with developing methods without explicitly writing code.

12. AI value creation by 2030 is 13 trillion

13. AI can be sub divided into two section
    1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence (smart speakers, self driving car, etc)
    2. Artificial General Intelligence (Very advance)

14. What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is the branch of AI which focuses on METHODS which can LEARN from EXAMPLES and EXPERIENCES instead of relying on hard coded rules.

15. Difference between Classical AI and Machine Learning: 
Classical AI contains RULES and DATA and gives Answers.
Machine Learning in which Answers and data are defined and it give us the rules.

16. Models are based on Algorithms and Algorithms are based on Rules.

17. Model = Algorithm + Data

18. Prompt engineering is another big field

19. Supervised learning:
A simple example is a model which is developed for the checking 
if the image given to the model is of cat or not. (Two category)

20. Now how to train this model. We train the model by giving
the image of the cat and ask whether this image is of cat or
not. If it says that the image is not cat then we tell it that
it is image of cat. (FEEDBACK).

21. In supervised learning we have labeled data (annotation) 
and it is important. (Input/Output data)

22. Before 2022: Mostly we were doing supervised learning in
which we have too much labeled data and we trained the 
model on that.

23. Example of supervised learning is:

	1. Input: Email, Output: Spam, Application: Spam Filtering
	2. Input: Audio, Output: Text transcript, Application: Speech tranlation
	3. Input: English, Output: Chinese, Application: Machine Translation
	4. Input: Ad, user-info, Output: Click(0/1), Application: Online Advertising
	5. Input: Image, Radar-info Output: Position of other cars, Application: Self-Driving Cars
   6. Input: Image of product, Output: Defective(0/1), Application: Visual Inspection

24. These are supervised AI application examples.

25. When the data is not labeled then we cannot apply the supervised learning.

26. There are two sections in supervised learning
   1. Training the model
   2. Making Prediction from the trained model

27. There are two types of supervise learning
   1. Classification (When we have different classes of data like cat, dog, parrot during trainig and in the prediction we are expecting an out from either of these categories). Classification - Categories.
   2. Regression (When we are trainig the model on a certain values and in the output we also expect the values). Regression - Score.


28. API (Application Programming Interface) is layer which takes information from one side to another.

29. API also plays important part of the security 

30. Difference between structured and unstructured data. Unstructured data is speed or audio. Image is also an example of unstructured data. Structured data includes data in excel sheet or sql.
