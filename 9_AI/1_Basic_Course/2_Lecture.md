1. Until 2022, 80% of AI was supervised learning

2. Large Language Model (LLM) is a basic building block of AI in which the input is a text and the output is also a text.

3. AI has some basic things like:
    1. Object detection: Detecting the car objects.
    2. Smart sticks for blind peoples to help them so move around.
    3. Classification: Spam and not spam emails
    4. Segmentation: Assigning boundaries to different objects in the image
    5. AI means to allow it to sense things like visuals and make some judgement.
    6. Generative models: Means when give input/data to some model then it gives some more information on it. Like ChatGPT (Generative Model) (Dall E)


4. Mechaine Learning is a popular way of doing AI.

5. In supervised learning we have input/output pair of data
    1. The data must be labeled data (Anotated Data)
    2. There are two modes:
        1. Trainig Mode: In which we train the model with one 1 set of data.
        2. Testing Mode: In which we test the model to check how it is working.
    3. During prediciton mode the model is not in the trainig mode
    4. The input/output pair of data is very important because when the model is in the learning mode then we can tell the model that if you have predicted the wrong answer then this is the correct result so update yourself.

6. Unlearn is a topic in the Neural network.

7. 100% accuracy is not good. Because in real world scenario when if we have data of different type then it will predict wrong result.

8. In supervised learning when we have data we use 70% of data in training the model and 30% data testing the model (Validation)

9. AI is good when if it is generative AI which means it can generate someting.

10. Now moving towards unsupervised learning

11. In the actual world we have most of the data which is unlabeled which we dont want to miss out. For example if we have to train a model which 50K images which are not labeled then we need we need some kind of learning pattern that we can use it to train the model with the unlabelled data. This is where unsupervised learning comes into action.

12. The basic idea of unsupervised learning is to make grouping of data of similar properties. The another name for grouping is called clustering.

13. Unsupervised learning is pattern finding technique

14. Anamoly detection means to find something weird.

15. Every classification model learns a FUNCTION. In AI model there is a function that converts a input to output. If we learn a good function then we have a good model.

16. To measure a classification model there is term called accuracy.

17. We test the accuracy of the model on both training data and test data. 

18. If the accuracy of the model on training and test data are same then it is a good model.

19. If training accu > test accu = over fitted model

20. If test accu > trainig accu = under fitted model

21. In unsupervised learning we have 3 important types:
    1. Clustering
    2. Dimentionality Reduction (Like moving from 3d to 2d)
    3. Annamoly Detection
