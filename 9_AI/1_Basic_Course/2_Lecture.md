1. Until 2022, 80% of AI was supervised learning

2. Large Language Model (LLM) is a basic building block of AI in which the input is a text and the output is also a text.

3. AI has some basic things like:
    1. Object detection: Detecting the car objects.
    2. Smart sticks for blind peoples to help them so move around.
    3. Classification: Spam and not spam emails
    4. Segmentation: Assigning boundaries to different objects in the image
    5. AI means to allow it to sense things like visuals and make some judgement.
    6. Generative models: Means when give input/data to some model then it gives some more information on it. Like ChatGPT (Generative Model) (Dall E)


4. Mechaine Learning is a popular way of doing AI.

5. In supervised learning we have input/output pair of data
    1. The data must be labeled data (Anotated Data)
    2. There are two modes:
        1. Trainig Mode: In which we train the model with one 1 set of data.
        2. Testing Mode: In which we test the model to check how it is working.
    3. During prediciton mode the model is not in the trainig mode
    4. The input/output pair of data is very important because when the model is in the learning mode then we can tell the model that if you have predicted the wrong answer then this is the correct result so update yourself.

6. Unlearn is a topic in the Neural network.

7. 100% accuracy is not good. Because in real world scenario when if we have data of different type then it will predict wrong result.

8. In supervised learning when we have data we use 70% of data in training the model and 30% data testing the model (Validation)

9. AI is good when if it is generative AI which means it can generate someting.

10. Now moving towards unsupervised learning

11. In the actual world we have most of the data which is unlabeled which we dont want to miss out. For example if we have to train a model which 50K images which are not labeled then we need we need some kind of learning pattern that we can use it to train the model with the unlabelled data. This is where unsupervised learning comes into action.

12. The basic idea of unsupervised learning is to make grouping of data of similar properties. The another name for grouping is called clustering.

13. Unsupervised learning is pattern finding technique

14. Anamoly detection means to find something weird.

15. Every classification model learns a FUNCTION. In AI model there is a function that converts a input to output. If we learn a good function then we have a good model.

16. To measure a classification model there is term called accuracy.

17. We test the accuracy of the model on both training data and test data. 

18. If the accuracy of the model on training and test data are same then it is a good model.

19. If training accu > test accu = over fitted model

20. If test accu > trainig accu = under fitted model

21. In unsupervised learning we have 3 important types:
    1. Clustering
    2. Dimentionality Reduction (Like moving from 3d to 2d)
    3. Annamoly Detection

22. Now reinforcement learning which means doing 1 thing (practice) multiple times is reinforcement. Like driving the cycle 

23. In reinforcement learning we have two main parts
    1. Agent (Player)
    2. Environment (Ground)

24. If the agent performs a good job then he gets a reward otherwise he gets a penalty

----

25. Now taking about deep learning

26. In human brain we have neurons that helps the brain to make decisions

27. So we created artificial neuron

28. Artificial neuron takes the input - process - output. For example MAX function (RELU) which takes 2 numbers as input, finds the max between the two and give the output number.

29. Artificial nuron network is a collection of MAX function that works in the way that takes the input process it and produce a result.

30. Neurons are Funstion. Some examples of functions are RELU (MAX function), Sigmoid that maps the any value between 0 and 1.

31. In neural network we have input, neurals, and output. The neurons takes multiple inputs process them because they are functions and produces the output.

32. If you have any sufficient number of neurons then we can build any function.

33. Artificial neural network is a Universal Approximator.

----

34. The study of artificial neural network is called deep learning.

35. Doing Machine Learning with Artificial Neural Network is called Deep learning.

36. The artificial neural network comcept was came in the year 1965 but the most growth came in the year 2022. This is because previouslt we dont have much computational power and then once we build the technology then we were able to process more data in much faster speed.

37. The property of the neural network is that the more data we provide it, the more the network learns.

38. Chat GPT 3 (Large Language Model - LLM) has total 176 billion neurons. It is a model.

---

39. The difference between normal AI and Generative AI is the DISCRIMINATING factor. Discriminating means you are doing classification, clustering, deduction, agent - environment actions. In Generating AI we are doing some generation.

40. Types of generative AI are neural network models includes - Auto incrementers, Generative Adversory Network (GAN), Transformers. 

41. Transformers have two parts:
    1. Transform the input so that it can be easily understood by the computer.
    2. Use the computer transformed input and the user query and generates the results

42. GPT stands for Generative Pretrained Transformers
