1. The best way of doing AI is by doing Machine Learning.

2. The model works in two modes either inference in which the model is predicting the output against the unknown input and the second mode is the training of the model.

3. Basics of NLP : natural language processing.

4. In NLP we have main concepts
    1. Stemming: move to core word like Jumping : Jump. The word is moved to simple form like removing "ing" or "ed".
    2. Lemmatization: It is the more advance version of Stemming because it moves the word in more appropriate form like from "Caring" to "Care"
    3. Tokenization: This means to spliting the long phrase into simple words so that model can understande is properly

5. AI applied on images and videos then it is called Computer Vision

6. AI applied on text then it is called Natural Language Processing

7. AI applied on audio then it is called Speech Recognition

8. All these are the applied form of AI

9. Semantic means meaning wise similar.

10. Semantic search means that if a user search on the browser than it looks for semantic of the entered words to get similar answer.

11. Here ChatGPT works as it takes the result and give to ChatGPT to make it more user readable format.

12. Prompt engineering is also very important. To build conversion for getting proper results includes:
    1. Establish background
    2. Explain the task properly
    3. Put proper constraints
    4. Get the output
