# In this lecture we are going to learn about errors in python
# Traceback/Stack Trace are very important to identify the error

# There are different types of errors in Python

# IndexError: when you access index of a list which does not exist.

# KeyError: when you try to access the key which does not exist in the 
# dictionary.

# NameError: when the variable is not defined and you are trying to
# access it. 

# AttributeError: Occurs with obejects like intersection is used with list
# instead by sets

# NoImplementedError: You can use this error to show a message for 
# example if you have impleted a method which has nothing to do at the 
# moment then you can use this syntax to display message.
# example is : raise NotImplementedError('This feature is not there')

# RuntimeError: It is a base class error and other errors which inherits
# from this error.

# SyntaxError: When you forget to add any colon or some other symbol.

# IndentationError: When you forget to add indentation

# TabError: When you put tab instead of using space indentation

# TypeError: For example you are tring to add int and string

# ValueError: Only occurs when tiy are using builtin function for example
# when you are trying to convert string to int which contains decimal 
# points.

# ImportError: When you are tring to import somthing from library.

# DepricationWarning: when you use raise DepricationWaring('to tell something')
